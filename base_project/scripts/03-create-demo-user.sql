-- Note: In a real Supabase project, you would create users through the Supabase Auth interface
-- This is just for demonstration purposes
-- You can create a user manually in the Supabase dashboard under Authentication > Users
-- Email: admin@italytravel.com
-- Password: admin123

-- For now, let's just create a placeholder profile that will be linked when the user signs up
-- The actual user creation should be done through Supabase Auth UI or API
